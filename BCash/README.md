# BCash
It is a simple oop project. Made it by myself as a brushing my concepts of OOP.
I have used python for doing this.
In the project, I merged some of my knowledge of data structures and algorithms to handle some cases, also some python libraries such as getpass library to mimic actual system,

Some of the features:
* User authentication system
* Payment transaction system between payments
* Password hiding(Only to follow conventional system)
* Recharge the balance

I only used raw concepts to build the projects and handle the cases.
